Solution 1 (Found via Recursive Brute-force Algorithm)
497 403

Solution 2 (Found via Heuristic Described Below)
168 410 291 31

The heuristic used to find Solution 2 is a modified iterative greedy algorithm, where at each step the action which moves
the subset sum closer to the target sum is taken. The subset sum is allowed to exceed the target sum, and elements
can be removed from the subset. Crucially, if an action would produce a subset sum which has already been seen, that action
cannot be performed, which encourages the heuristic to explore the problem space.
